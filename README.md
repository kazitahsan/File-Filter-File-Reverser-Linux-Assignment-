# File-Filter-File-Reverser-Linux-Assignment-
# CS 2308 (Texas State University - Ziliang Zong)

This project contains two parts: linked list, stack, and queue.

Part 1:
In the first part, you will implement the copy constructor and overloaded assignment operator using the provided NumberList.h and NumberList.cpp files. The test.cpp file and the output.txt file are also provided to verify if you have implemented these two functions correctly.

Part 2:
In the second part, you will solve the File Reverser problem and the File Filter problem by utilizing the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) stacks and queues respectively.
File Reverser: Write a program (named as file_reverser.cpp) that opens the input.txt file and reads its contents into a stack of characters. The program should then pop the characters from the stack and save them in the output_reverse.txt file. The order of the characters saved in output_reverse.txt should be the reverse of their order in the input.txt file.
File Filter: Write a program (named as file_filter.cpp) that opens the input.txt file and reads its contents into a queue of characters. The program should then dequeue each character, convert it to uppercase, and store it in the output_filter.txt file. The order of the characters saved in output_filter.txt should be the same as their order in the input.txt file, but all in uppercase.

Sample Output:
input.txt: This is the original file.
output_reverse.txt: .elif lanigiro eht si sihT
output_filter.txt: THIS IS THE ORIGINAL FILE.
